        <h3> Speak English with more confidence.</h3>

        <p>
            I can help you feel comfortable and confident speaking English in a variety of social, educational and work situations. This is done with personally tailored lessons to focus on strengthening your skills. I have taught English as a second/foreign language in Atlanta, Brazil and New York, for almost twenty years. Most of my experience has been at Westchester Community College in Valhalla, New York. Teaching the higher levels, I noticed that some students have practically learned all the English they can, yet they still don’t feel comfortable at a party or talking to their children’s teachers.

        <h3>Pass that English proficiency exam.</h3>

        <p>With over fourteen years of experience proctoring and evaluating English proficiency exams, I know what is needed to pass. There are three important components to the exam. The first being the obvious one of your knowledge and comprehension of English. Although, there are a few tips that will help. Lastly, knowing what to expect and your attitude about the exam can make a big difference as well.
